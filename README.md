This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Database migrations on Vercel

This project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for database access and migrations. On every deployment, Vercel runs the `postinstall` script which automatically generates the Prisma client, runs any pending migrations against the Neon PostgreSQL database, and executes the seed script.

To enable this behaviour, set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your Vercel project settings to your Neon connection string. The `postinstall` script skips migrations and seeding when `DATABASE_URL` is not defined.

Manual commands are available for local development:

```bash
npm run migrate # Apply migrations
npm run seed    # Run the seed script
```
